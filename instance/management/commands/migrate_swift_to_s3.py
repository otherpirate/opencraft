Migrate SWIFT assets to S3.
One-time script.


Detailed process to migrate 1 server:
- download all SWIFT files to local with rclone, as a reference and backup and as a guide to know what you'll be copying
- check and take note of the current status settings of the instance to migrate
- set into the script the IDs of the instances to migrate
- also set the region (use Ireland)
- enable all conditional parts (change the "if 0:" to "if 1:") the first time. When you re-run it you may use this to skip some migration steps or for debugging
- run script, from Ocim production (just place the file and run it, no need to change branches). The command is: honcho -e .env run ./manage.py migrate_swift_to_s3
- let the script copy everything, watch for errors, re-run if it fails (some AWS things take time and you may need to wait some seconds between re-runs)
- when the script successfully copies files, let it save() the instance with the new settings
- check settings and deploy new server with the blue button
- wait 2 h and test it
- to be extra careful: download the files from SWIFT again and compare with them with the first download. If they differ it means files changed during those 2 h; then do a 2nd SWIFTâ†’S3 sync to keep them up to date, then activate the new server
- if the server doesn't work, don't activate it; restore storage_type to swift (you may delete the IAM user and bucket too, from the AWS web interface)
- if the instance has high activity or constantly moving files, do a final sync after you activated the new server (from the deactivated server to the activated one). Or you could have scheduled a downtime for this
- don't delete old files from the SWIFT container (from OVH) and so don't delete the container. The container could have been used to create URLs for uploaded images that are linked from forum posts. These URLs still point to SWIFT, and you don't want to go through mongo fixing the posts. Don't delete SWIFT settings from the OpenEdXInstance object either; it's better to leave them as they were, to show that the SWIFT container still exists
- delete ~/.config/rclone/ if still there
